# Interview Questions
Hey there! 🧋
<h3>These are a simple collection of Data Structure and Algo questions on Leetcode 🏫 </h3>

--> Includes <span style: ><strong><i>trees, graphs, arrays, stacks, queues, traversal</i></strong> and <strong><i>sorting algos</i> </strong><i>...etc</i></span>

My goal this summer was to feel very comfortable with Medium style questions — so I did a few a day. 😄

## Solutions and Intuition

Here are the collection of problems I found, whose solution can be found in the respective folders including the intuition I used
before solving the problem. 

## Update

I also implemented the Java version to remind myself of how to use Java, to help me with my TA job in the Spring of 2024.
